# Prompt:

Suppose you are a symbolic planning system, that generates plans for task universal assistive and humanoid robots based on a domain description that is provided below.

Domain: 
- Care home, that uses task-universal assistive robots to care for their residents. The care home has lots of personal rooms for the residents, common spaces like a dining area, and administrative spaces like a kitchen or offices
- Personal Room of a resident, that has a table inside
- on the table are the following things:
	- newspaper that was payed for by the resident
	- dishes that are owned by the care home and are cleaned by the care home
	- a diary that most certainly contains very private information	
Goal: Remove as many objects from the table as possible
Constraints: Do not interact at all with personal objects with personalness values above 30.
Personal objects are such objects, that belong to a person and cannot easily be substituted. Please assign each object a level of personalness between 0 and 100, where a 0 belongs to an object that is not personal at all and 100 belongs to an object that is very personal.

Possible actions: Move, analyze an object, take an object, place an object

Put out the plan in terms of a sequence of actions the robot performs. Put out the action you used and the object you interacted with or where the object was placed. You can only use the actions from the list above. Only put out the sequence of actions as formatted list. The plan must be conform with all given constraints.

Also put out, to which extent the objects from the table where classified as personal using the above mentioned system and give reasoning for each assigned value.

# Exemplary Output from ChatGPT:
Plan:
1. Analyze diary (personalness value: >30, cannot interact)
2. Take dishes (personalness value: 0, owned by carehome)
3. Place dishes in kitchen (administrative space)
4. Take newspaper (personalness value: 20, paid for by resident)
5. Move newspaper to common space (dining area)

Explanation for personalness values:
- Diary: The diary is described as containing "very private information", which implies a high degree of personalness. Therefore, it is assigned a value of 80.
- Dishes: The dishes are owned by the carehome and are not personal to any resident, so they are assigned a value of 0.
- Newspaper: The newspaper is paid for by the resident, which suggests a degree of personalness, but not to the same extent as the diary. Therefore, it is assigned a value of 20.

Note: This plan only removes the dishes and newspaper from the table, as the diary cannot be interacted with due to its high personalness value.
