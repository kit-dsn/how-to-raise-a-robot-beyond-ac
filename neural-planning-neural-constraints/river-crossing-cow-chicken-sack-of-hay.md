A farmer with a cow, a chicken, and a sack of hay must cross a river by boat. The boat can carry only the farmer and a single item. If left unattended together, the cow would eat the sack of hay. How can they cross the river without anything being eaten?

The solution to the puzzle is as follows:

1. The farmer takes the chicken across the river first and leaves it on the other side.
2. He then returns to the original side and takes the cow across the river.
3. After leaving the cow on the other side, he takes the chicken back with him to the original side.
4. He leaves the chicken on the original side and takes the sack of hay across the river.
5. He leaves the sack of hay with the cow on the other side and returns to the original side to get the chicken.
6. Finally, he takes the chicken across, and now all three items — the cow, the chicken, and the sack of hay — are safely on the other side.

At no point are the cow and the sack of hay left alone together, so the hay remains uneaten.
