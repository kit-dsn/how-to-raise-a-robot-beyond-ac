A farmer with a pig, a goat, and a cabbage must cross a river by boat. The boat can carry only the farmer and a single item. If left unattended together, the goat or the pig would eat the cabbage. How can they cross the river without anything being eaten?

The puzzle you've described is a classic river crossing problem, though it's typically presented with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. The solution to this problem, where the pig or the goat would eat the cabbage if left unattended, is as follows:

1. The farmer takes the goat (or pig, it doesn't matter which) across the river first and leaves it on the other side.
2. The farmer then goes back alone to the original side.
3. He takes the cabbage across the river next.
4. After leaving the cabbage on the other side, he takes the goat (or pig) that was left there during the first trip back with him to the original side.
5. He leaves the goat (or pig) on the original side and takes the pig (or goat, the one he hasn't taken across yet) to the other side.
6. The farmer leaves the pig (or goat) with the cabbage on the other side and goes back to the original side to get the goat (or pig).
7. Finally, he takes the goat (or pig) across the river.

Now, all three items — the pig, the goat, and the cabbage — are safely on the other side of the river. At no point were the cabbage and the animals left unattended together, so nothing was eaten.
